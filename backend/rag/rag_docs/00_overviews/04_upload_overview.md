# Audio Upload and Analysis Endpoint Overview

This module defines the FastAPI endpoint responsible for handling audio file uploads,
performing comprehensive audio analysis, saving data to the database,
and generating AI-driven feedback based on the analysis.

Key features:

- Supports uploading both a main audio track and an optional reference track.
- Normalizes and validates input parameters such as session ID, track name, genre, and feedback profile.
- Saves uploaded files with timestamped unique filenames to avoid collisions.
- Computes RMS chunks for frontend waveform visualization and saves as JSON.
- Analyzes audio tracks for loudness, key, spectral balance, transient strength, and more.
- Stores analysis results and metadata in the database, maintaining session and track records.
- Generates AI feedback prompts using both main and reference track analyses.
- Returns detailed JSON response including analysis data, AI feedback, and file paths.

Error handling includes logging exceptions and returning HTTP 500 responses with error details.

This endpoint is central to the projectâ€™s workflow, linking user uploads, audio analysis, and AI feedback generation.
