# Audio Analysis Module (audio_analysis.py)

This module contains core audio analysis utilities used to extract musical and technical features from audio data to support AI feedback generation in the music mixing and mastering assistant.

The functions cover a wide range of analyses including:

- Detecting the musical key of an audio track.
- Computing energy distribution across frequency bands.
- Describing the low-end profile relative to music genres.
- Assessing spectral balance in mixes.
- Measuring loudness and dynamic range with RMS calculations.
- Detecting transient strength and characterizing transient quality.
- Identifying peak level issues such as clipping risks.
- Performing comprehensive audio feature extraction combining multiple analyses.

Each function is documented separately for detailed explanations and usage notes.
