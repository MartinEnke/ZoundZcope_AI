# Function Explanation: summarize_thread (chat.py)

This function defines an API endpoint to generate a concise summary of a follow-up conversation thread
between a user and the AI assistant regarding audio track feedback.

Key responsibilities include:

- Receiving a summary request containing session ID, track ID, and follow-up group index.
- Retrieving all chat messages within the specified session, track, and follow-up thread from the database.
- Filtering messages to identify user inputs and assistant responses.
- Formatting the conversation transcript as a role-labeled dialogue to provide context.
- Creating an AI prompt that instructs the language model to produce a clear, actionable summary of the thread.
- Returning the AI-generated summary as a JSON response.
- Handling cases where no follow-up messages exist by returning an appropriate notice.

---

**Inputs:**

- A `SummarizeRequest` Pydantic model with:
  - `session_id`: User session identifier.
  - `track_id`: Audio track identifier.
  - `followup_group`: Index of the follow-up thread to summarize.
- Database session for querying chat history.

---

**Outputs:**

- JSON response containing the AI-generated summary text or a message if no follow-up messages are found.

---

**Design Notes:**

- The function preserves the conversational order by sorting messages by timestamp.
- User and assistant messages are explicitly labeled in the prompt for better AI understanding.
- The prompt guides the AI to focus on distilling key improvement strategies from the conversation.
- This summarization helps manage lengthy follow-up threads by creating digestible insights.
- Handles empty threads gracefully to avoid unnecessary AI calls.
