# Function: get_feedback (chat.py)

This function serves as the FastAPI endpoint for generating AI-based mixing or mastering feedback
on a user’s uploaded audio track.

It performs the following key tasks:

- Normalizes user input parameters such as genre, feedback type, and detail level.
- Retrieves the pre-computed audio analysis data from the database associated with the track.
- Constructs a detailed AI prompt using this data to tailor feedback precisely.
- Sends the prompt to an AI language model to generate mixing/mastering guidance.
- Saves the AI’s feedback response into the database for conversation history.
- Returns the generated feedback text in JSON format to the frontend.

This separation of concerns allows the API endpoint to handle request validation,
database interaction, and AI integration cleanly.

---

**Inputs:**

- `track_id`, `session_id`, `genre`, `type`, `feedback_profile`, and a DB session.

**Output:**

- A JSON response containing the AI-generated feedback or an error message.

---

**Design notes:**

- The function relies heavily on helper functions like `normalize_genre` and `generate_feedback_prompt`.
- Audio analysis data is pre-calculated and stored for efficiency.
- Feedback is saved to enable chat-style interaction history for users.
