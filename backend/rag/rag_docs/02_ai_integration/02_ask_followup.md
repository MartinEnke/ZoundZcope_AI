# Function Explanation: ask_followup (chat.py)

This function handles the API endpoint for managing AI-driven follow-up questions related to audio track feedback.

Key responsibilities include:

- Receiving a follow-up request containing the user’s question, previous AI feedback, session and track IDs, and other context.
- Retrieving the main audio track’s analysis data from the database.
- Optionally fetching a reference track’s analysis to provide comparative context.
- Looking up any existing summary of previous follow-up messages to inform the AI prompt.
- Constructing a detailed prompt for the AI that combines audio analysis, prior feedback, user question, and conversation context.
- Sending the prompt to the AI model and capturing its response.
- Saving both the user’s question and the AI’s answer as chat messages in the database to maintain conversation history.
- Automatically generating a concise summary of the follow-up thread after a certain number of user questions, which aids future context management.

**Inputs:**

- A `FollowUpRequest` Pydantic model containing fields such as `analysis_text`, `feedback_text`, `user_question`, `session_id`, `track_id`, `feedback_profile`, `followup_group`, and optional `ref_analysis_data`.
- Database session for querying and saving track data and chat messages.

---

**Outputs:**

- A JSON response containing the AI-generated answer.
- Optionally indicates if a new summary of the follow-up thread was created.

---

**Design Notes:**

- Utilizes a Pydantic model to validate and structure the incoming follow-up request.
- Uses session and follow-up group IDs to manage threaded conversations and retrieve prior context.
- Fetches reference track data to enable comparative feedback where applicable.
- Implements logic to automatically summarize conversation threads to avoid prompt overload and improve AI efficiency.
- Handles errors gracefully by raising HTTP exceptions if critical data (e.g., main track) is missing.
- Persists both user and assistant messages for conversational continuity.
