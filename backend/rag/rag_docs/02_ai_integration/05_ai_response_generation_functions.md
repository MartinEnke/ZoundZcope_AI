# AI Response Generation Functions (gpt_utils.py)

This section contains core functions responsible for interacting with the AI model:
sending prompts and retrieving generated responses for both initial feedback and follow-up questions.

---

## Function: `generate_feedback_response`

- Sends a fully constructed prompt string to the AI language model using OpenAI’s chat completion API (`gpt-4o-mini` model).  
- Assumes the prompt includes all necessary context, instructions, and audio analysis data.  
- Returns the textual feedback generated by the AI, trimmed of extraneous whitespace.  
- Handles the communication with the API, encapsulating request and response parsing.

---

## Function: `generate_followup_response`

- Facilitates multi-turn conversational interactions by building a follow-up prompt that incorporates:  
  - The original audio analysis text.  
  - Previous AI feedback to maintain context.  
  - The user’s latest follow-up question.  
  - An optional summary of prior follow-up conversation threads to keep prompts concise and contextually rich.  
- Uses the `build_followup_prompt` helper to construct the detailed prompt.  
- Delegates actual AI communication to `generate_feedback_response`.  
- Designed to support seamless, context-aware multi-step feedback sessions.

**Usage Notes:**

- These functions form the backbone of AI communication in your project.  
- They ensure prompts are sent and responses received cleanly and consistently.  
- Designed for modularity: prompt construction and API calls are separated for easier maintenance and testing.
