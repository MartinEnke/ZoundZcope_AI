# 8. Audio Analysis Technical Details

## Feature Extraction Process

- Load audio.
- Normalize audio for certain analyses.
- Convert to mono for certain analyses.  
- Calculate peak, LUFS, RMS (average and peak).  
- Detect tempo and key using music information retrieval algorithms.  
- Measure dynamic range and stereo width metrics.  
- Compute spectral band energies and characterize low-end.  
- Analyze transient strength and identify peak warnings.

## Comparison with Manual Measurements

- Manual tests done with tools like Voxengo Span, Waves PAZ, Waves InPhase.  
- Tables of metric comparisons show close agreement with some expected discrepancies.  
- Limitations and differences in plugin sensitivities explained.
