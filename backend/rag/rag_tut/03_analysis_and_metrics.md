# 3. Analysis and Metrics Explained

## Audio Processing Steps

- Load audio file and convert to mono for analysis where needed.  
- Normalize certain metrics for consistency.  
- Extract peak level, loudness (LUFS), RMS average and peak.  
- Detect tempo and musical key.  
- Measure dynamic range and stereo width.  
- Compute spectral band energies and low-end profile.  
- Analyze transient strengths and generate peak warnings.

## Importance for Mixing vs Mastering

Each metric informs different aspects of mixing and mastering:  
- Peak and RMS indicate levels and headroom.  
- LUFS relates to perceived loudness.  
- Tempo and key help with musical context.  
- Dynamic range and stereo width influence perceived depth and space.  
- Spectral and transient info guide tonal balance and punch.
