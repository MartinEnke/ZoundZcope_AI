# 2. Uploading Tracks and Sessions

## Track Upload Flow

- Upload your main audio track (mixdown or master).  
- Optionally upload a reference track to guide the feedback towards a desired sound.

## Session Management

- Choose or create a session name for each analysis.  
- Sessions store multiple tracks and allow users to review historical feedback later.
