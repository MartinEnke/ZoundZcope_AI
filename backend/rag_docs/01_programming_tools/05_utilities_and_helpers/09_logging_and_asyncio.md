# Python Standard Libraries: Logging and Asyncio

### Logging

- Provides a flexible framework for emitting log messages from Python programs.
- Used extensively to record app behavior, errors, and debug information.

### Asyncio

- Supports writing concurrent code using async/await syntax.
- Underpins asynchronous frameworks like FastAPI, enabling efficient I/O handling.

### How they're used in this project

- Logging records key events and errors in backend services for troubleshooting.
- Asyncio enables non-blocking handling of concurrent requests, file uploads, and AI calls.
