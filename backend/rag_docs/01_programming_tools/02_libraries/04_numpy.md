## NumPy

[NumPy](https://numpy.org/) is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.

### Why NumPy?

- **Array Operations:** Efficient multidimensional arrays and matrix math.
- **Mathematical Functions:** Supports advanced mathematical operations needed for audio processing.
- **Foundation:** Many audio and ML libraries are built on NumPy arrays.

### How itâ€™s used in this project

NumPy is used extensively for:

- Signal processing calculations.
- Array manipulations during spectral analysis.
- Numerical operations in loudness and dynamic range computation.
