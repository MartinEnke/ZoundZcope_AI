## FastAPI

[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. It provides asynchronous capabilities and automatic interactive API documentation.

### Why FastAPI?

- **High Performance:** Supports asynchronous operations making it ideal for handling uploads, AI prompt calls, and multiple users concurrently.
- **Easy API Design:** Leverages Python type hints to build clear and concise endpoints.
- **Automatic Docs:** Generates Swagger/OpenAPI documentation automatically, aiding frontend-backend integration.
- **Dependency Injection:** Simplifies managing database sessions and authentication with built-in dependency system.
- **Built-in Validation:** Integrates tightly with Pydantic for request validation and response serialization.

### How itâ€™s used in this project

FastAPI forms the backbone of the backend API, handling:

- Audio file uploads.
- Triggering audio analysis workflows.
- Managing user sessions and tracks.
- Generating AI feedback and follow-up responses.
- Exporting feedback as PDFs.
