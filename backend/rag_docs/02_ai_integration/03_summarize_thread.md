# Function: summarize_thread

```python
class SummarizeRequest(BaseModel):
    session_id: str
    track_id: str
    followup_group: int
```

This Pydantic model defines the expected structure of the request payload for summarizing a follow-up thread:

- **session_id**: Identifier for the current user session.  
- **track_id**: Identifier of the audio track for which the follow-up thread exists.  
- **followup_group**: Index of the follow-up conversation thread to summarize.

```python
@router.post("/summarize-thread")
def summarize_thread(req: SummarizeRequest, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    """
    Generate a summary of a follow-up conversation thread.

    Retrieves chat messages for a given session, track, and follow-up group,
    then uses AI to summarize the thread into a concise improvement strategy.

    Parameters:

        db (Session): Database session for querying chat messages.

    Returns:

              no follow-up messages are found.

Explanation:
This API endpoint generates a concise summary of a specific follow-up conversation thread between the user 
and AI assistant. It retrieves all messages for the given session, track, and follow-up group, 
formats them into a conversational transcript, and prompts the AI to distill the discussion into actionable 
improvement strategies. If no follow-up messages exist, it returns a notice indicating so.
