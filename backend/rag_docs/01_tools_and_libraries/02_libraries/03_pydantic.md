## Pydantic

[Pydantic](https://pydantic.dev/) is a Python library for data validation and settings management using Python type annotations. It plays a key role in ensuring robust, safe, and clear data handling within this AI-powered music assistant project.

### Why Pydantic?

- **Input Validation:** Ensures all API requests contain the required fields with correct data types, preventing invalid data from causing errors downstream.
- **Automatic Parsing:** Converts incoming JSON or form data into Python objects with properly typed attributes, simplifying backend logic.
- **Clear Error Reporting:** Provides detailed error messages when validation fails, helping debug issues quickly.
- **Seamless FastAPI Integration:** FastAPI uses Pydantic models to define request and response schemas, enabling automatic API documentation and developer-friendly interfaces.
- **Maintains Explicit Data Contracts:** Makes your data models self-documenting and easy to maintain, which is especially valuable for complex AI feedback interactions.

### How it's used in this project

The project uses Pydantic models to define the expected structure for key API endpoints:

- **`FollowUpRequest`**: Defines all the data required to process a user's follow-up question to the AI feedback, including analysis texts, session and track IDs, and optional reference track data.
- **`SummarizeRequest`**: Defines the parameters needed to summarize follow-up conversation threads, including session ID, track ID, and follow-up group index.

Using Pydantic allows the backend to robustly handle AI feedback workflows, providing structured and validated data to the AI models while maintaining clear communication protocols between frontend and backend.

This approach improves both developer experience and reliability, making it an essential tool in the architecture of this AI mixing/mastering assistant.
